  "text": "In a recent turn of events, Operation Sindoor—a major initiative led by the Indian Army—has come under heavy criticism from the Congress party. Congress leaders have accused the government of politicizing military operations and have questioned the motives behind the mission. Several Congress spokespersons claimed that the operation was used for political mileage rather than national security, and some even made statements that were perceived as disrespectful to the Indian Army's efforts and sacrifices. The controversy has sparked widespread debate on social media, with many expressing outrage over Congress's remarks and their perceived lack of respect for the armed forces."
